Types by Communication Protocols:
REST (Representational State Transfer) API

Definition: RESTful APIs use HTTP requests for communication and usually exchange data in JSON format.
Example: GitHub API, Twitter API.
SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) API

Definition: SOAP APIs use XML for message formatting and are typically more secure, but heavier compared to REST.
Example: Payment gateways, legacy financial systems.
GraphQL API

Definition: A query language API that allows clients to request specific data in a more efficient way compared to REST.
Example: GitHub GraphQL API.
gRPC API

Definition: gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) APIs use Protocol Buffers (binary serialization) for communication, which is faster and more efficient.
Example: Services within Google or Netflix.
WebSockets API

Definition: WebSockets enable real-time communication between the client and server by maintaining an open connection.
Example: Real-time messaging applications like chat services or stock tickers.
RPC (Remote Procedure Call) API

Definition: In RPC, the client executes code on a remote server using either JSON-RPC or XML-RPC.
Example: Systems using microservices architectures for distributed services.
These are the common types of APIs used in various applications today. Each type serves a specific use case and is chosen based on factors like performance, ease of use, and security needs.
